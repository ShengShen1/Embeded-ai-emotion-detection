There are three files in the github repo:
1.Efnetb0_transferlearning_not_adapted.ipynb. This jupyter notebook is where the transfer learning + fine tuning techniques are performed, but it shows pool results. So this model is not adpated.
2. efnet_adapted.ipynb. This jupyter notebookis where the EfficientNet-b0's weight is trained from scratch and the weight is adapted where we used in our final results.
3. emotion_detection.py. This is the file that we deployed in our raspberry Pi. It can either take a live video as input or an image.
